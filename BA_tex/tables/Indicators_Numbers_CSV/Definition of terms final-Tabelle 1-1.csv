TERM;DEFINITION
ad hoc adaption;Worker may decide during execution phase when to complete a task or not complete. Additionally, workers may adapt rules and decisions.
automation;Human workers can be replaced by systems. No human intervention necessary apart from failures and monitoring. 
complex decisions;Complex decisions require the processing of at least one input factor (e.g. calculation of salaries). They also require several input factors and cannot be mapped by yes or no answers.
control flow oriented;The main characteristic of the process is a strict control flow. 
data centric ;Processing data is central for the process and is mandatory to achieve the goal.
decisions driven by rules or events ;Events trigger decisions and rules define the way the control flow takes. 
dependency decisions ;A decision has sub-milestones that need to be reached in order to proceed with the superior decision. A sub-milestone can be a decision or any aggregation of input factors. 
evolving circumstances ;Workers may adapt the process flow and the performed tasks according to influential factors (e.g. emergencies) during execution.
flexible workflow;The sequence of activities can be derive from the designed process model during execution.
human centric;The worker is the defining element of the process and cannot be replaced. Contrary to data centric. 
knowledge driven;Workers adhere to their experience and best practices instead of strict directives. 
orchestrated;The model captures all branches and execution variants of the process according to directives. No adaption during execution phase necessary.
predefined ;All parts of the process, especially of the control flow and decisions, are known in the design phase. No adaption necessary during execution phase.
repeatable ;The model can be completely repeated in a second instance without any changes. 
routine work ;Work that can be repeated exactly the same way many times. 
simple decisions;Yes or no questions. 
stateful condition ;The execution of activities is depending on the respective status and can for instance be paused, resumed or aborted.
strict control flow ;During the execution phase, there is no deviation from the intended sequence of activities and decisions allowed. 
structured ;Structure implies a link from each element to a corresponding one, surrounded by a start and stop element. 
unstructured ;Links between elements are partly existing, they are not compulsory. No defined start or stop event.
