Category;Definition
Documentation;During process identification and process discovery, the gathered information is usually denoted in a document. Each modeling language corresponds to a more or less specific style of documentation.
Preceding process map ;Process discovery should result in macro models showing how processes cooperate or how single processes roughly look like. These can be used to identify the correct modeling language. 
Characteristics of work;Describes the work illustrated by the process (e.g. ad hoc, routine work, decision intensive, rule intensive etc.). 
Characteristics of process;Desired process to be captured in the model (e.g. business process, case, decisional process, workflow etc.).
Characteristics of decisions;Decisions can be simple or complex. 
Control flow;Control flow can be necessary or unnecessary, strict or flexible. Different types of flows are also allowed as in this category (e.g. dependencies, information flow). 
intervention at run-time;Example from practical applications and typical use case scenarios.
Objective;Target the process model is intended to achieve.
Typical application;Illustration and use cases for each standard to help associating the process with similar ones.
