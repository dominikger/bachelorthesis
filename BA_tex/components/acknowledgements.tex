First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. rer. pol. Hans-Arno Jacobsen and the Chair for Application and Middleware Systems for giving me the chance to cover the issue of business process management in my thesis. Without the help of my supervisor Martin Jergler, who designed this issue with me, the whole thesis would never have come to existence. Thank you Martin for your support and for all the experience I gained in this project. \\
I'm especially thankful for the support of my family and friends, namely Julia Mayer, Ralf Gerbershagen, Mario Weiherer and Peter Pfrommer, who helped me with the revision and always gave me advice when I needed it. You inspired me during the time of writing and encouraged me to always do better. Thank you so much!
